# Quantum_TP_Identification_DNN

This repo contains the code and supplemented documents for the paper "Quantum topology identification with deep neural networks and quantum walks" that will be published on NPJ computational materials.

The readers are free to use, modify and distribute the corresponding code and documents without the authors' consent, however it will be appreciate the paper could be cited.

This repo mainly consists of four parts: 1. the Matlab scripts for generating the data; 2. the tools for preparing the data complying with format of TensorFlow, which is a Deep Learning library open-sourced by Google; 3. the python code for doing the experiment, like model training and testing, as well as scripts for analysing the results; 4. supplemented documents for easing understanding of corresponding work.

(we will upload in a procedural way, the whole uploading process might take couple of weeks at longest.)
